# RingCentral-Add-In-Framework(Github Demo)

This template aims to help you quickly set up your app with 3rd party webhook integration.

# Prerequisites

- Download and install RingCentral App and login: https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/rc-app
- Nodejs and npm.

# How It Works

There are 3 major parts involved:
- Setup:
  - Get RingCentral App info
  - Auth on 3rd party and subscribe to events
- Use:
  - Process and forward 3rd party event notifications to RingCentral App via webhook
- Revoke:
  - Unsubscribe and clear user info

# Try It

Let's give it a quick try.

## Step.1 Start Web Tunnel

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# create db file - additional note: 'npm run refreshDB' command will clear DB and re-init it
npm run initDB 

# start proxy server, this will allow your local bot server to be accessed by the RingCentral service
npm run ngrok

# will show
Forwarding                    https://xxxx.ngrok.io -> localhost:6066
# Remember the https://xxxx.ngrok.io, we will use it later
```

ngrok will expose your local server to a public address where you can have other services interact with it.

Note: your local firewall might block certain ngrok regions. If so, try changing `ngrok http -region us 6066` in `package.json` to [other regions](https://www.google.com/search?q=ngrok+regions).

## Step.2 Set Up Environment Info

Firstly, we want to create a `OAuth App` on https://github.com/settings/developers. In app creation page, fill `Authorization callback URL` with `https://xxxx.ngrok.io/oauth-callback`. Note: `Homepage URL` isn't important, you can fill it with a dummy url.

After it's created, we'll see `ClientId` and let's also generate a `ClientSecret`.

Rename `sample.env` to `.env` and `sample.env.test` to `env.test`(env for test). There are several OAuth-related fields in `.env` need to be set.

```bash
# .env file

# local server setup
PORT=6066
APP_HOST=localhost
# Copy `https://xxxx.ngrok.io` from last step
APP_SERVER=https://xxxxxx.ngrok.io
# This is the key string to encrypt server-client communication credentials
APP_SERVER_SECRET_KEY=sampleKey 

# Github Oauth
# ClientId from Github OAuth App
CLIENT_ID= 
# ClientSecret from Github OAuth App
CLIENT_SECRET= 
ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
AUTHORIZATION_URI=https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
SCOPES=admin:repo_hook,read:user,repo
SCOPES_SEPARATOR=,

# This can be any repo name that you want to watch, it's recommended to create a new test repo for initial try
GITHUB_REPO_NAME= 

# RingCentral developer portal
# You'll need a RingCentral App first, and this can then be found on developer portal, under App Settings
IM_SHARED_SECRET= 

# db uri
DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI=sqlite://./db.sqlite
# client-side UI asset path
ASSETS_PATH=http://localhost:8081
```

## Step.3 Start Local Server and Client

```bash
# open a new terminal
# start local server
npm run start

# open another new terminal
# start client app
npm run client
```

Go to RingCentral App and add your app to a conversation, `Auth` -> `Subscribe` -> `Finish`. It should then provide the ability to listen to `New Issue` event and also give user ability to add any label to the issue.

To test it, go to your Github repo and create a new issue. There should be an adaptive card sent to your RingCentral App conversation which also provides buttons for you to add labels to your issue.

### Tips

- [Adaptive Cards Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) is a great online tool to design your Adaptive Cards. Json files under `src/server/adaptiveCards` follow the same format as in `CARD PAYLOAD EDITOR`, so you can design your card on [Adaptive Cards Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) and copy over the payload directly.
- `npm run refreshDB` to delete existing db file and create a new one

# Workflow Diagram

Note: if you don't have Markdown view, please open the flow diagram directly from `diagram/flow.svg`.

![flow](./diagram/flow.svg)

Refer to [Workflow Diagram](#workflow-diagram), sections are explained with user actions as below:

- `Authorization` ([workflow 3-7](#workflow-diagram)): Press `Connect to 3rd Party Service and Subscribe`. And do authorization on a new page rendered by 3rdp arty service.
- `Subscription` ([workflow 8-11](#workflow-diagram)): Upon the close of auth page, the framework will automatically trigger subscription creation (in practice, it's recommended to create a separate flow for auth and subscription).
- `Notification` ([workflow 12-15](#workflow-diagram)): Once the subscription is created, notifications from 3rd party service should be sent to our endpoint on `https://xxxx.ngrok.io/notification`. And notification data will be transformed and sent to RingCentral App.
- `Interactive Message` ([workflow 16-30](#workflow-diagram)): Any user in RingCentral App conversation who has the 3rd party account would be able to perform actions within RingCentral App. New users will need to authorize first.
- `Revoke` ([workflow 31-33](#workflow-diagram)): Press `Unsubscribe and Logout`, and incoming notifications will stop being sent to RingCentral App.

# Additional Note

There are several npm packages to be highlighted here:
- [octokit rest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/rest): Github's official npm package to make API calls easy.
- [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package//sequelize): Node.js database ORM tool
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [client-oauth2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-oauth2): OAuth2 wrapper
- [serverless](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless): serverless framework

When start development, it's recommended to use 3rd party's official npm package for its API calls.

# Deployment

## Register App on RingCentral Developer Website

Create your app following [this guide](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/applications).

## Deploy with Serverless

### 1. Compile JS files

```
$ npm run client-build
```

And get all JS assets file at public folder. Upload all files in public into CDN or static web server.

### 2. Create `serverless-deploy/env.yml` file

```
$ cp serverless-deploy/env.default.yml serverless-deploy/env.yml
```

Edit `serverless-deploy/env.yml` to set environment variables.
We will get `APP_SERVER` after first deploy. So now just keep it blank.

### 3. Create `serverless-deploy/serverless.yml` file

```
$ cp serverless-deploy/serverless.default.yml serverless-deploy/serverless.yml
```

Edit `serverless-deploy/env.yml` to update serverless settings.
The Dynamo `TableName` should be `${DYNAMODB_TABLE_PREFIX}webhooks`. `DYNAMODB_TABLE_PREFIX` is environment variable that we set upper. `ASSETS_PATH` is uri where you host JS files in `Step 1`.

### 4. Deploy

```
$ npm run serverless-build
$ npm run serverless-deploy
```

In first deploy, you will get lambda uri in console output: `https://xxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`.
Copy the uri, and update environment variable `APP_SERVER` with it in `serverless-deploy/env.yml` file. Then deploy again:

```
$ npm run serverless-deploy
```
