# RingCentral-Add-In-Framework

The framework will help you create a RingCentral Add-In App that subscribes to 3rd party notifications via webhook and forward incoming notifications from 3rd party server to RingCentral App.

This project aims to help you quickly set up a local test environment so that you can move from there and integration 3rd party functionalities in.

`!!!IMPORTANT!!! This framework is composed by some mock actions which replace the actions from a 3rd party API server. All places with ===[Replace]=== tag should be replaced with the actual logic that handles interactions with 3rd party service`
